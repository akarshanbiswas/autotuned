Advanced Linux Power Management script to save power on portable Linux devices.(Works with systemd)
This is a script which tweaks the hardware on Linux to save power whenever the system runs on battery by changing cpu schedulers and putting harddrives and Wifi adapters to enter into a low power state without touching or creating any conflict on the base system.


How differnt is this script from tlp?

Well,
1)It does not keep running in the memory. It just do it's thing and exists.
2)Doesn't conflicts with the currently running Desktop environment configurations.
3) Can be remove pretty easily



Contributions and testers are welcome. We are now moving to a world of portable mobile devices and Linux distributions on these devices are still not that up to the mark. Driver issues occur because of OEM decisions to support only the world dominating platforms.
